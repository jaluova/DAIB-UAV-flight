Within DAIB-Explorer, only occupancy integration and current-goal blockage
checks follow the 10 Hz input. Dirty-frontier processing runs at 10 Hz, goal
candidate evaluation at 4 Hz, and trajectory-visit maintenance at 1 Hz.
Mission-lifetime observation memory reuses the bounded ray samples from each
accepted cloud, with per-frame deduplication and a multi-frame stability
threshold. Structural coverage and submap ownership come from PVBSM. These stages share
one serialized core rather than independent worker threads, so rate separation
does not introduce map races.

PVBSM affects only the 4 Hz candidate score. Candidate positions are queried
as one batch under one short memory lock. The score continuously penalizes
well-covered submaps and exact represented roots, rewards unseen submaps, and
adds a bounded structural-support term during degeneracy. The rolling
occupancy map remains the sole collision authority.

Before scoring, DAIB-MCSVF spatially clusters the active frontier set and
converts each boundary cluster into one wall-clear known-free viewpoint.
Candidates then pass scene-specific vertical/climb limits and a three-tier
heading/distance filter. Straight free segments require no graph search; only
wall-occluded candidates invoke bounded A* over known-free planning voxels.
Repeated selections of the same coarse frontier with little vehicle progress
activate a temporary escape tier that blacklists recent clusters. These
operations stay inside the 4 Hz goal stage and do not add work to FAST-LIVO2.

## Four map layers

1. **Rolling occupancy map**: bounded by `planning_map_radius_m`, updated at
   `map_update_rate_hz`, and used for collision/frontier queries.
2. **Active frontier set**: updated only around cells whose occupancy state
   changed. Per-update work is capped by `frontier_update_budget`.
3. **Mission observation memory**: monotonic coarse cells that answer only
   whether an area was stably observed during this Explorer process. It is not
   a collision map. The node snapshots it periodically and restores it only for
   watchdog recovery; a normal mission launch starts with an empty snapshot.
   Historical cluster filtering is enabled by default so rolling-map pruning
   does not recreate old frontiers.
4. **Structural exploration memory**: coarse visited trajectory cells plus
   DAIB-PVBSM. Its detailed plane/residual cache is bounded, while a compact
   per-submap observed-root bitmap survives detailed-record demotion. With the
   default 8x8x8 block, the coverage bitmap is 512 bits (64 bytes) per
   represented submap. PVBSM remains the only structural submap
   representation. The mission observation memory stores only coarse counters
   and evidence flags, without copying FAST-LIVO2's estimator octree or visual
   feature map.

FAST-LIVO2 local-map retirement and PVBSM forgetting are deliberately
separate. A root leaving the estimator window arrives as one archived
plane/residual summary and remains observed. When the detailed-record capacity
is reached, Explorer removes only detailed geometry and retains the observed
bit and submap coverage count. Only a hard-deletion record, source-session
reset, or mission reset clears long-term coverage.

The first three layers can be discarded/rebuilt if the explorer restarts;
SLAM localization is unaffected. Persisting and exchanging the fourth layer is
the future dual-UAV extension.

## Compute isolation

The node uses a queue of one for planning clouds and performs work only from a
timer. LIO runtime is smoothed locally and changes only the explorer's ray,
frontier-update and candidate-evaluation budgets. No callback into FAST-LIVO2
exists. If one 10 Hz update overlaps the next timer tick, the new tick is
discarded rather than queued.

## Multi-UAV extension point

The implemented 64-byte PVBSM record carries `source_id`, revision, root voxel
coordinates and submap edge length. The receiver derives a spatial submap key,
rejects stale per-root revisions and keeps remote/lightweight geometry outside
the high-frequency local rolling map. A later radio transport still needs
frame alignment, packet integrity, missing-revision recovery and conflict
fusion before records from another UAV are accepted.
